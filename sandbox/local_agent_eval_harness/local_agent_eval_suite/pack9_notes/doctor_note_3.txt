Assessment/Impression:
Type 2 Diabetes with mild hypoglycemic episodes likely due to inconsistent meal timing. Good overall control, but needs better dietary consistency to prevent drops in blood glucose.

Plan:

Advise patient to schedule consistent meal/snack times and avoid skipping meals.
Continue Metformin 1000 mg BID.
Consider nutrition counseling referral for meal planning, particularly on busy workdays.
Reinforce lifestyle measures: daily exercise, weight management.
Return in 3 months for repeat labs and follow-up; sooner if recurrent hypoglycemia occurs.
